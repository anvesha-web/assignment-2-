    "\n",
    "theoritical questions \n",
    "\n",
    "1 What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "Interpreted: Code is executed line by line by an interpreter (e.g., Python). Slower but easier to debug.\n",
    "Compiled: Entire code is translated into machine code before execution (e.g., C++). Faster but less flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "Exception handling is a mechanism to deal with runtime errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally block\n",
    "\n",
    "3 What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "The finally block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred. It's used for cleanup (e.g., closing files).\n",
    "\n",
    "4 What is logging in Python?\n",
    "Logging is a way to record events (errors, warnings, info, debug messages) during program execution for debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "__del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It’s used for cleanup (e.g., releasing resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "6 What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
    "import module → imports the whole module, access via module.function().\n",
    "from module import function → imports specific functions/objects directly.\n",

    "8 What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
    "It ensures the file is automatically closed after use, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9 What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "Multithreading: Multiple threads share the same memory space. Good for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Multiple processes run independently with separate memory. Good for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "10 What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
    "Better than print() for debugging.\n",
    "Can save logs to files.\n",
    "Supports different levels (INFO, ERROR, etc.).\n",
    "Helps in monitoring and auditing.\n",

    "11 What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "It’s how Python handles memory allocation and deallocation, including garbage collection and reference counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "12 What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "Write risky code inside try.\n",
    "Handle error in except.\n",
    "Optional else block executes if no exception.\n",
    "finally executes always for cleanup.\n",

    "13 Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "Prevents memory leaks.\n",
    "Ensures efficient use of resources.\n",
    "Improves performance and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "14 What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "try: Wraps code that might throw an error.\n",
    "except: Defines how to handle the error if it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "15 How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "Uses reference counting (tracks object references).\n",
    "Uses garbage collector for cyclic references (objects referring to each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "16 What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "17 What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
    "DEBUG → Detailed info (for developers).\n",
    "INFO → General information.\n",
    "WARNING → Something unexpected but not fatal.\n",
    "ERROR → A serious issue occurred.\n",
    "CRITICAL → Very serious error, program may crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "18 What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "os.fork() → Unix-only, creates a new process by duplicating the current one.\n",
    "multiprocessing → Cross-platform library that spawns processes in a Pythonic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "19 What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
    "Frees system resources.\n",
    "Ensures data is written (flushed) to disk.\n",
    "Prevents file corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "20 What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
    "read() → Reads the entire file (or specified number of bytes).\n",
    "readline() → Reads one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "21 What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
    "It provides functions and classes to record log messages, configure logging levels, and store logs in files or other outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "22 What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
    "The os module lets you interact with the operating system: create/remove directories, check file paths, change directories, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "23 What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
    "Memory leaks from circular references.\n",
